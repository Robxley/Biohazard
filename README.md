# Biohazard

The biohazard project is a set of libraries / executables that I develop for fun in my personal computer vision applications / projects (image processing, 3D, video games, etc.)

## Biohazard3d

3D engine based on OpenGL / SDL / ImGui for 3d graphic applications.

## Biohazardgui

Compilation of simple libraries (SDL, ImGui and OpenCV) to provide a GUI in image processing.

## Modulazard

Module framework for quick tests of image processing algorithms.

Mainly base on OpenCV.


### Work in progress !
